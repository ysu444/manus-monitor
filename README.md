## 📋 Overview

This repository provides **real-time monitoring data** for the Manhaj 2030 project, a state-of-the-art Islamic Hadith Named Entity Recognition (NER) system. Data is automatically updated **every minute** from the production server (45.32.106.139) and served via **SHA-based URLs** with **zero CDN caching** to ensure LLMs and consultants always access the latest information.

**Key Features:**
- ✅ **Real-time updates** (every 1 minute via Cron)
- ✅ **Zero CDN caching** (SHA-based URLs - v4.0 breakthrough!)
- ✅ **Always fresh data** (< 60 seconds latency)
- ✅ **Comprehensive metadata** (file sizes, timestamps, commit SHA)
- ✅ **15 active agents** monitoring system health and project progress
- ✅ **DHVS 2025 compliant** scientific closure tracking

## 🚀 Quick Start for LLMs (Claude, GPT, etc.)

### ⚠️ IMPORTANT: How to Avoid Stale Data

**❌ WRONG WAY (Returns Cached Data):**
```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ysu444/manus-monitor/main/manifest.json
```
☝️ This URL uses GitHub CDN and may return data that is **5-60 minutes old**!

**✅ CORRECT WAY (Always Fresh Data):**

### Step 1: Read the Manifest (You Can Use /main/ Here)

```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ysu444/manus-monitor/main/manifest.json
```

The manifest itself can be slightly cached, but it contains the **commit SHA** which points to fresh data.

### Step 2: Extract the Commit SHA

The manifest looks like this:

```json
{
  "generated_at": "2025-10-25T12:48:01Z",
  "generated_at_unix": 1761395281,
  "commit_sha": "5a6824b123abc...",
  "commit_sha_short": "5a6824b",
  "version": "4.0.0",
  "description": "Manus Monitor - Real-time data with SHA-based URLs (zero CDN caching)",
  
  "direct_links": {
    "raw_github_live": {
      "description": "Use these links for real-time data (zero cache)",
      "manifest": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ysu444/manus-monitor/main/manifest.json",
      "state": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ysu444/manus-monitor/5a6824b/manhaj2030/monitor/state.json",
      "agents_status": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ysu444/manus-monitor/5a6824b/manhaj2030/pmc/inbox/AGENTS_STATUS.json",
      "pmc_events": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ysu444/manus-monitor/5a6824b/manhaj2030/pmc/memory/events.jsonl",
      "pmc_unified": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ysu444/manus-monitor/5a6824b/manhaj2030/pmc/unified/pmc_unified_latest.md",
      "scientific_closure": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ysu444/manus-monitor/5a6824b/manhaj2030/reports/scientific_closure_v1.md",
      "realtime_state": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ysu444/manus-monitor/5a6824b/manhaj2030/monitor/realtime_state.json",
      "system_info": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ysu444/manus-monitor/5a6824b/system-info.json",
      "pm2_status": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ysu444/manus-monitor/5a6824b/pm2-status.json"
    }
  }
}
```

### Step 3: Use the URLs from `direct_links.raw_github_live`

**These URLs contain the commit SHA (e.g., `/5a6824b/`) instead of `/main/`**

This is the key! Each commit has a unique SHA, so:
- ✅ Every minute = new commit = new SHA = new URL
- ✅ GitHub cannot cache (every URL is different!)
- ✅ You always get fresh data (< 60 seconds old)

---

## 🎯 Example: Correct Usage

**Query:** "What's the current system status?"

**LLM Process:**

```
1. Read: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ysu444/manus-monitor/main/manifest.json
   → Get: commit_sha_short = "5a6824b"

2. Use the SHA-based URL from manifest:
   Read: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ysu444/manus-monitor/5a6824b/manhaj2030/monitor/state.json
   
3. Analyze the data:
   {
     "timestamp": "2025-10-25T12:41:55.721017Z",
     "events_total": 346,
     "last_event": "F5_TRAINING_FULL_SUCCESS",
     "system": {
       "cpu": 0.0,
       "mem": 1.5,
       "disk": 14.7,
       "overall": "green"
     }
   }

4. Report: System is healthy! Last updated 7 minutes ago (fresh data ✅)
```

## 📊 Available Data Files

### Essential Files (Always Fresh with SHA-based URLs)

| File | Size | Description | URL Pattern |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|:------------|
| **manifest.json** | ~2 KB | Master index with latest commit SHA | Use `/main/` first, then extract SHA |
| **state.json** | ~1 KB | System state (GPU, CPU, Events, Agents) | Use SHA from manifest: `/{SHA}/manhaj2030/monitor/state.json` |
| **AGENTS_STATUS.json** | ~2 KB | Status of all 15 active agents | Use SHA from manifest: `/{SHA}/manhaj2030/pmc/inbox/AGENTS_STATUS.json` |
| **system-info.json** | ~500 B | CPU, Memory, Disk, Uptime | Use SHA from manifest: `/{SHA}/system-info.json` |
| **pm2-status.json** | ~100 B | PM2 process status | Use SHA from manifest: `/{SHA}/pm2-status.json` |

### Detailed Files (Read Selectively)

| File | Size | Description | Reading Strategy |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|:-----------------|
| **events.jsonl** | ~30 KB | PMC event log (JSONL format) | **Read last 50 lines only** (most recent events) |
| **scientific_closure_v1.md** | ~15 KB | Scientific closure report | Read summary sections first |
| **realtime_state.json** | ~50 KB | File monitoring state | Search for specific files or read first 100 lines |
| **pmc_unified_latest.md** | ~100 KB | Comprehensive PMC documentation | **Read table of contents first**, then specific sections |

---

## ⏰ Update Schedule

| Component | Update Frequency | Actual Data Changes |
|-----------|------------------|---------------------|
| **Data on Server** | Every 10 minutes | `collective_state.json` updates every 10 minutes |
| **Push to GitHub** | Every 1 minute | New commit with new SHA every minute |
| **Data Freshness** | < 10 minutes | You'll see 10 identical commits before data changes |

**Why 10 identical commits?**
- The server updates data every **10 minutes**
- But pushes to GitHub every **1 minute**
- So you'll see the same data in 10 consecutive commits
- This is **normal and by design**!

---

## 🧪 How to Verify Data is Fresh

Check the `timestamp` field in `state.json`:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-10-25T12:41:55.721017Z",
  ...
}
```

**Fresh data:** Timestamp should be < 10 minutes from current time  
**Stale data:** Timestamp is > 15 minutes old (something is wrong!)

- **Capacity:** Sufficient for all Phase F4-F10 and G-series work
- **Scalability:** 16 GPUs support up to 16-way parallel training

**When to reconsider:**
- Training LLMs with **>7B parameters**
- Requiring **H100 architecture** (next-gen Hopper GPUs)
- Need for **>16 GB VRAM per GPU** (current: 16 GB A16)

**Current verdict:** Infrastructure is optimal for Manhaj 2030 NER project requirements.

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### How SHA-based URLs Work

**Traditional GitHub Raw URL:**
```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ysu444/manus-monitor/main/state.json
                                                            ^^^^
                                                            Branch name (cached!)
```

**SHA-based URL (v4.0):**
```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ysu444/manus-monitor/5a6824b/state.json
                                                            ^^^^^^^
                                                            Commit SHA (unique!)
```

**Why this solves caching:**
- Each commit has a **unique SHA**
- New commit every minute = **new SHA** = **new URL**
- GitHub CDN sees it as a **different resource** = **no cache hit**
- Result: **Always fresh data!**

---

### Cron Job Configuration

The monitoring system runs on the server:

```bash
# /etc/crontab
* * * * * root /srv/manhaj2030/monitor/monitor_upload.sh >> /srv/manhaj2030/pmc/memory/monitor_upload.log 2>&1
```

**What it does:**
1. Collects system data (CPU, RAM, GPU, Disk)
2. Reads PMC data (events, agents, reports)
3. Generates manifest.json with current commit SHA
4. Commits and pushes to GitHub
5. Creates new SHA → new URLs → zero cache!
