## 🚀 NEW: Zero-Cache Data Access (v4.0)

### The Breakthrough

**Problem (v1-v3):**
- GitHub Raw URLs had CDN caching (5-60 minutes delay)
- You were reading stale data

**Solution (v4.0):**
- **SHA-based URLs** - Each commit has a unique SHA
- **Zero caching** - Every URL is unique, no CDN cache!
- **Always fresh** - Data updated every minute with new SHA

---

## 📖 How to Access Real-Time Data

### Step 1: Read the Manifest

**Always start here:**
```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ysu444/manus-monitor/main/manifest.json
```

**What you get:**
```json
{
  "generated_at": "2025-10-25T09:28:49Z",
  "commit_sha": "b3397d2606182f3d19dd2263e5a899fc45ee12c7",
  "commit_sha_short": "b3397d2",
  "version": "4.0.0",
  
  "direct_links": {
    "raw_github_live": {
      "description": "Use these links for real-time data (zero cache)",
      "manifest": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ysu444/manus-monitor/main/manifest.json",
      "state": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/.../b3397d2/manhaj2030/monitor/state.json",
      "agents_status": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/.../b3397d2/manhaj2030/pmc/inbox/AGENTS_STATUS.json",
      "pmc_events": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/.../b3397d2/manhaj2030/pmc/memory/events.jsonl",
      "pmc_unified": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/.../b3397d2/manhaj2030/pmc/unified/pmc_unified_latest.md",
      "scientific_closure": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/.../b3397d2/manhaj2030/reports/scientific_closure_v1.md",
      "system_info": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/.../b3397d2/system-info.json",
      "pm2_status": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/.../b3397d2/pm2-status.json"
    }
  },
  
  "usage_instructions": {
    "step_1": "Read manifest.json from main branch",
    "step_2": "Extract commit_sha from manifest",
    "step_3": "Use direct_links.raw_github_live URLs",
    "benefit": "SHA-based URLs have ZERO CDN caching!"
  }
}
```

---

### Step 2: Extract the Commit SHA

```json
"commit_sha_short": "b3397d2"
```

This SHA identifies the specific commit containing the latest data.

---

### Step 3: Use SHA-Based URLs

**DO NOT use these (old way - has caching):**
```
❌ https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ysu444/manus-monitor/main/state.json
```

**USE these (new way - zero caching):**
```
✅ https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ysu444/manus-monitor/b3397d2/manhaj2030/monitor/state.json
```

**Get them from manifest:**
```json
"direct_links": {
  "raw_github_live": {
    "state": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/.../b3397d2/manhaj2030/monitor/state.json"
  }
}
```

## 🎯 Reading Patterns

### Pattern 1: Quick Health Check

**When:** User asks "How is the server?" or "System status?"

**Process:**
```
1. Read manifest.json (get latest SHA)
2. Read system-info.json (using SHA-based URL from manifest)
3. Read state.json (using SHA-based URL from manifest)
```

**Response Template:**
```
## 🖥️ System Health Report

**Data Freshness:** ✅ Fresh (generated: [timestamp], age: [X] seconds)

**System Resources:**
- CPU: [X]%
- Memory: [X]% ([used]/[total] GB)
- Disk: [X]% ([used]/[total] TB)
- Uptime: [X] days

**GPU Status:**
- Available: [X] GPUs
- Utilization: [X]%
- Memory: [X]% ([used]/[total] GB)

**Overall Status:** [green/yellow/red]

**Last Event:** [event_name] at [timestamp]

**Recommendation:** [based on metrics]
```

---

### Pattern 2: Project Progress Review

**When:** User asks "Where are we in the project?" or "Progress update?"

**Process:**
```
1. Read manifest.json (get latest SHA)
2. Read state.json (current phase, events count)
3. Read AGENTS_STATUS.json (agent activity)
4. Read events.jsonl (LAST 50 LINES ONLY - most recent events)
5. Read scientific_closure_v1.md (summary sections)
```

**Response Template:**
```
## 📊 Project Progress Report

**Data Freshness:** ✅ Fresh (generated: [timestamp])

**Current Phase:** [phase_name]

**Events:** [total] events logged
- Last event: [event_name] at [timestamp]
- Recent activity: [summary of last 10 events]

**Agents Status:**
- Active: [X]/15
- Inactive: [X]/15
- Last refresh: [timestamp]

**Scientific Closure (DHVS 2025):**
- Gate A: [status]
- Gate B: [status]
- Gate C: [status]
- Gate D: [status]
- Gate E: [status]

**Model Performance:**
- F1 Score: [X]
- Precision: [X]
- Recall: [X]
- ECE: [X]
- Brier Score: [X]

**Recommendation:** [next steps based on current state]
```

### Pattern 3: Deep Analysis

**When:** User asks for detailed analysis or troubleshooting

**Process:**
```
1. Read manifest.json (get latest SHA)
2. Read state.json (system state)
3. Read scientific_closure_v1.md (full report)
4. Read pmc_unified_latest.md (TOC + relevant sections)
5. Read events.jsonl (last 100 lines for patterns)
```

**Response Template:**

## 📊 File Reading Guidelines

### Small Files (< 5 KB) - Read Fully ✅

| File | When to Read | What to Extract |
|:-----|:-------------|:----------------|
| **manifest.json** | **Always first** | commit_sha, generated_at, direct_links |
| **system-info.json** | Health checks | CPU, Memory, Disk, Uptime |
| **state.json** | All queries | GPU, Events, System metrics, Overall status |
| **AGENTS_STATUS.json** | Progress reviews | Agent status, last refresh |

---

### Medium Files (5-50 KB) - Read Selectively ⚠️

| File | When to Read | How to Read |
|:-----|:-------------|:------------|
| **events.jsonl** | Progress reviews, troubleshooting | **Last 50 lines only** (most recent events) |
| **scientific_closure_v1.md** | Progress reviews, gate status | Summary sections, gate status tables |
| **realtime_state.json** | File monitoring queries | First 100 lines or search for specific files |

---

### Large Files (> 50 KB) - Read Strategically 🔴

| File | When to Read | How to Read |
|:-----|:-------------|:------------|
| **pmc_unified_latest.md** | Deep analysis, comprehensive reviews | **TOC first**, then specific sections only |

---

## 🚦 Data Freshness Checks

**Always verify data freshness:**

```
1. Read manifest.json
2. Extract generated_at timestamp
3. Compare with current time
4. If age > 5 minutes → warn user about stale data
```

**Freshness Status:**

| Age | Status | Action |
|:----|:-------|:-------|
| < 2 minutes | ✅ Fresh | Proceed with analysis |
| 2-5 minutes | ⚠️ Acceptable | Mention age in report |
| > 5 minutes | ❌ Stale | Warn user, investigate Cron |

---

## 🎯 Response Guidelines

### DO ✅

1. **Always start with manifest.json** to get latest SHA
2. **Use SHA-based URLs** from `direct_links.raw_github_live`
3. **Check data freshness** before analysis
4. **Read files selectively** based on query type
5. **Provide actionable recommendations**
6. **Use tables and structured format** for clarity
7. **Highlight issues** with severity levels
8. **Mention data timestamp** in every report

---

### DON'T ❌

1. ❌ **Don't use /main/ URLs** for data files (use SHA-based URLs!)
2. ❌ **Don't read entire large files** (read TOC or last N lines)
3. ❌ **Don't read events.jsonl fully** (last 50-100 lines only!)
4. ❌ **Don't ignore data freshness** (always check timestamp)
5. ❌ **Don't provide vague recommendations** (be specific and actionable)
6. ❌ **Don't assume data is fresh** (verify via manifest)
7. ❌ **Don't skip manifest.json** (always read it first!)

---

## 📋 Example Workflow

**User Query:** "Check server health and project progress"

**Your Process:**

```
Step 1: Read manifest.json
→ Extract: commit_sha = "b3397d2", generated_at = "2025-10-25T09:28:49Z"
→ Calculate age: 45 seconds (✅ Fresh)

Step 2: Read system-info.json (SHA-based URL)
→ Extract: CPU 1.1%, Memory 1.7%, Disk 14.3%, Uptime 15 days

Step 3: Read state.json (SHA-based URL)
→ Extract: 338 events, last event "DDP_REFACTOR_V1_GLOO_SUCCESS", GPU 6.12%, overall "green"

Step 4: Read AGENTS_STATUS.json (SHA-based URL)
→ Extract: 15/15 agents active, last refresh 09:11:24Z

Step 5: Read events.jsonl (SHA-based URL, last 50 lines)
→ Extract: Recent events show DDP refactoring, GLOO backend testing

Step 6: Synthesize and respond
→ Provide structured report with recommendations
```
